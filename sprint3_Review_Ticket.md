### College Board MCQ Corrections

Q15. Consider the following method, isSorted, which is intended to return true if an array of integers is sorted in nondecreasing order and to return false otherwise.

I picked answer choice I and II, because I forgot to check that II would produce an Out of Bounds error. Therefore the correct answer is only I.

Q18. Assume that myList is an ArrayList that has been correctly constructed and populated with objects. Which of the following expressions produces a valid random index for myList?

subtracting 1 from (int)(Math.random() * myList.size()) has the potential to produce a negative number, which is not possible for a random list index.

Q22. Which of the following best explains why the code segment will not compile?

I did not know that, because book[0] was initialized as a book, it is unable to call functions from AudioBook, despite being an AudioBook.

Q23. What will the contents of animals be as a result of calling manipulate?

I thought that the List used was an ArrayList, not a List. However, the List will not be tested in AP CSA anymore.

Q24. What is printed as a result of executing the code segment?

I accidentally misread the question as asking for newArray[0][1], not newArray[0][2].

Q34. Which of the following replacements for /* missing code */ will correctly implement the Circle constructor?

x and y can not be updated outside of the class, since it is a private instance variable.

Overall, I think I did well with this practice MCQ, and it showed me what I know well and need to work on.
I am struggling with inheritance and arrays, specifically ArrayLists.
