My biggest project this Sprint has been my mines project, which is a mainly individual project, but connects with Portfolio as a whole with Casino and Gamify.<br>
<br>
My backend has been mostly functional since winter break, and thus this times changes were very simple, completely migrating from localhost to javaURI and ensuring the connection works.<br>
In addition, due to the migration of the login system from email to GHID, I also needed to adapt to that change.<br>

My frontend had to undergo more changes.<br>
I completely revamped my frontend design to make it more bearable to look at (my css is not perfect yet, more changes will come).<br>
