    "Which of the following best explains why the code segment does not compile?\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose C: The first line of the subclass constructor is not a call to the superclass constructor, but the superclass constructor can be called from the first line of a subclass constructor, but it is not required. When the superclass constructor call is not present, Java automatically provides a call to the superclass’s no-argument constructor.<br>\n",
    "The correct answer was D: The getNumOfWatts method is not found in the Bike class, because at compile time, the declared type of b determines where the compiler looks for methods during method calls. In this case, b is declared to be of type Bike, but the getNumOfWatts method does not appear in the Bike class.\n",

If there is no empty adjacent location that is within the grid, the Grasshopper does not move, but turns 45 degrees to the right without changing its location.\n",
