In Prospect<br>
APCSP and APCSA have inspired me to continue CS into the future, which is why I decided to major in CS and CE. I have applied for a CS major or CE major in many well-known universities across the nation, such as Columbia University, UIUC, CMU, Stanford, and Purdue.<br><br>

I have already received a few acceptances (with hopefully more to come!).<br>

| 5 things you did over 12 weeks, Issues, Burn Down, lesson(s), presentation(s), analytics, personal blog | 4.7 | I maintained a Burndown list since the beginning of the sprint to keep track of the things I wanted to do and the things that I was able to accomplish. I mainly focused on my game feature for the first half of the trimester, but in the second half of the trimester, after I was able to confirm and polish my feature, I focused more on student team teaches and preparing for the College Board AP exam. |
| Full Stack Feature Demo, including Java and N@tM feedback                                               | 1.9 | I created the Mines game, and was able to polish it through playtesters and their feedback (such as revealing the mines locations after the game). I presented my game alongside the other Casino games during NATM, and we got mostly positive reivews.                                                                                                                                                         |
| Key Feature blog write up, visualization (drawIO, mermaid) in your blog                                 | 0.9 | I collaborated with Saaras Kodali to create a UML diagram for our games in Casino, and also collaborated with many people from Period 1 including Aidan and Dinesh to create a UML diagram that unified Gamify using a new feature: Global Bank.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| MCQ / FRQ work                                                                                          | 0.9 | I received a 35/39 on the MCQ with external support, which I am very proud of. I also finished the 2014 and 2015 FRQs and blogged them, alongside test cases to ensure that my code functions correctly.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 10th point                                                                                              | 0.8 | I shared my plans for the future and how they will relate to CS, sent a summary of my review 24hrs prior, and got a comment from the Rachit Jaiswal for feedback on this sprint.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
